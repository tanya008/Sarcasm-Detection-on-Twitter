# Sarcasm-Detection-on-Twitter
Course Project


The above paper has been implemented by us, which uses a behavioural modelling approach to classify tweets of a particular User. SVM classifier has been used to classify the tweets as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic based on some features calculated from user's past tweets and some calculated from the tweet which is being classified.
The whole project has been built in python. Java Twitter API has been used for collecting the dataset
